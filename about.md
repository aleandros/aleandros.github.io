My name is Edgar Cabrera. I'm a software engineer at Mexico City, currently working for Intelim√©trica.
I love programming, and learning about different technologies and paradigms. If I was to mention some
particular technologies in which I am both proficient and in love with, Ruby, Clojure, NodeJS and Python come to my mind.

I promised myself that this time I would really, REALLY maintain a blog
this time, and not abandon it for too long, so I can share my passion and, hopefully, some
insights I have gained over time about the whats, whys and hows of software development.

Also, if you're reading this, just be sure that I love you. No, seriously, you're amazing
and beautiful. At the very least you're tolerable but I love you anyway.

Peace,

Edgar Cabrera
